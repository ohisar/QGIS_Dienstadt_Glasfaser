 A fiber optic (Glasfaser) network planning project was conducted for Dienstadt, located in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. 
 The project involved the design and spatial planning of  high-speed broadband infrastructure using QGIS, an open-source 
 Geographic Information System.

Key activities included:

Data collection and preparation: I gathered and processed geospatial data relevant to the region, including building footprints, 
road networks, terrain models, and existing utility lines.

Route optimization: Using QGIS tools and spatial analysis, I identified the most efficient and cost-effective routes for fiber cable 
deployment, taking into account topographical and infrastructural constraints.

Network design: The project covered the planning of backbone and distribution lines, node placement, and connection points to residential areas 
and commercial units.

Visualization and documentation: Detailed maps and layout plans were produced to support implementation, including layer symbology, annotations, and legends.
